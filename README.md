Automatically sequence infrastructure initialization and teardown.

#### Installation

```
pip install chassis2024
```

### Brief Explanation

The idea is to make it so that you quickly reuse infrastructure components.

"Infrastructure" here means things like:
* writing a lock file for your program
* reading config files
* setting up a GUI system (like tkinter), and running a main loop
* populating and processing argparse
* reading a persistence file, and writing back to it when closing

I wanted to make it trivial to combine these infrastructure together.

The central challenge was making sure that everything runs in the right order.
